			<h3>"In the near future, everyone will work remotely, including those sitting across form you. You'll need this farsighted book to prepare for this inversion."</h3>

			<h3>The wisdom in these pages is edgy yet simple, straightforward, and proven. Read this book multiple times to help give you the courage you need to get out there and make something great.</h3>
